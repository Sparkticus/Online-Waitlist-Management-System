Walter
The Online Waitlist Management System (Part III)
Proposed by: Joanna Bi & Lindsey Tang


SUMMARY:


We are submitting a rapid prototype version of our final project “Walter: The Online Waitlist Management System”. At this point, we’ve ensured basic functionality of our web application. This includes having a completed backend structure that uses the MySQL database and integrating it with minor html code. We have coded the major components of our application, supporting operations such as creating professor and student accounts, creating waitlists, searching for existing waitlists, adding oneself to a waitlist, and viewing students on a specific waitlist. We’re glad to have achieved the large majority of our milestone goals. We plan to further develop the application by integrating session management tools, creating personalized homepages, widgets that would allow professors to rearrange the order of their waitlists and invoke online lottery, as well as building front-end features using the CSS Bootstrap framework. We’re excited for the next stages of our application development, and we look forward to receiving useful feedback.
